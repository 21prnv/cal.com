{DESCRIPTION}

## Week after week, not month after month

People think in days and weeks, not months. What’s tomorrow? Later this week? Next week? **The HEY Calendar is built around how you think**, not how paper calendars were designed.

## Time never stops, life is like a filmstrip

Life doesn’t look like a boxy calendar, it feels like a filmstrip. **HEY Calendar’s timeline-based day view is designed to tell the continuous story of your life**, one moment flowing into the next.

## Habits, time tracking, highlights, photos
**Establish a habit**, stick with it. **Track time spent** on any activity. **Circle important events** so they stand out. **Fill your days with pictures**, memories, or moments — not just events.
