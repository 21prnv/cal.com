title: 'How to add a date override'

Managing your availability with precision is essential for smooth scheduling, and that's where Date Overrides in Cal.com come in handy. Whether you're taking a day off, adjusting your schedule for a holiday, or simply unavailable for a specific day, overrides allow you to customize your availability on a case-by-case basis.

**What Are Date Overrides?**
Date Overrides are temporary changes to your availability for specific dates. Once the date has passed, these overrides are automatically archived, keeping your schedule clean and organized.

**Steps to Add a Date Override**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Availability Settings">
    * Log in to your Cal.com account.
    * Navigate to Availability in the sidebar. 
    </Step>
  <Step title="Click "Add an Override"">
* In the Availability page, look for the Add an Override button.
</Step>
  <Step title="Choose the Date">
* A calendar will appear. Select the specific date for the override (e.g., Wednesday).
</Step>
  <Step title="Set the Override Preferences">
* Adjust your availability for that day:
* Mark yourself as completely unavailable, or
* Specify custom hours for that date.
</Step>
  <Step title="Save the Override">
* Once you've configured the override, save it.
* Your new override will appear in the list of availability adjustments.
</Step>
</Steps>

**How overrides work**
* Temporary Changes: Overrides apply only to the selected date and will not affect your recurring availability schedule.
* Automatic Archiving: After the override date passes, it will be archived and no longer visible. This keeps your availability settings tidy.
