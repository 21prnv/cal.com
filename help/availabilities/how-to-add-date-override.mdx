**How overrides work**
* Temporary Changes: Overrides apply only to the selected date and will not affect your recurring availability schedule.
* Automatic Archiving: After the override date passes, it will be archived and no longer visible. This keeps your availability settings tidy.

**Why use overrides?**
* Take the day off for personal reasons.
* Adjust availability for holidays or special events.
* Handle one-off schedule changes without altering your entire weekly setup.
